**Quality Assurance Specialist with Technical and Leadership Expertise**

I am a seasoned QA professional with a comprehensive skill set in both technical and leadership domains. My approach to Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is highly customer-focused, employing a behavior-driven methodology (specification by example) to ensure that both human users and technical systems achieve the desired outcomes.

Since joining BSkyB in late 2005, I have honed my ability to blend code and process to address complex QA challenges. What sets me apart from others in my field is my proficiency in leveraging the right technology to transform behavioral specifications or requirements into precise, deterministic assertions of expected outcomes. This skill transcends specific toolsâ€”whether it's Ruby RSpec, Behave, Cucumber, or their variantsâ€”allowing me to ensure design targets are consistently met.

### Technical Proficiencies
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** Proficient with AWS, Azure, and GitHub, favouring a B/TDD or B/TDD-lite framework in Python or Ruby.
- **Tooling Solutions:** Strong track record in developing bespoke solutions where existing tools fall short, with experience in Python, PHP, C++, JavaScript, and shell scripting.
- **System Interaction:** Skilled in working with hardware devices, cloud-hosted systems, and various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, Mac OS, and cloud security posture assurance in AWS.
- **Test Automation:** Adept at UI/Browser automation combined with API testing for comprehensive QA coverage.

### Professional Background
I have been immersed in the technology field since completing my studies at Bath Spa University in 2005. Prior to my technology career, I gained valuable people and leadership skills as a Registered Nurse with the NHS, which I further formalised through a CMI Diploma during Sky's Leadership Development Program.

### Summary
My diverse background enables me to approach SQA with a unique blend of technical rigour and leadership acumen, consistently delivering high-quality, reliable software solutions.
