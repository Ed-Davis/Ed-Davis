**Quality Assurance Specialist with Technical and Leadership Expertise**

Hi, I am Ed. I am a seasoned QA professional with a comprehensive skill set in both tech and leadership . My approach to Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is highly customer-focused, usually employing a behavior-driven methodology (specification by example) when the context allows, with a fail fast and correct often approach. 

### Summary
I have been making things in software all my adult life from TRS80 Model III up to the Ubuntu maching Im typing this on. Mostly simple procedural stuff until I learned OO Perl and C++ around 2008, but I was trying to make sense of it all pretty early on. 

I make embedded devices and standalone applications for fun mainly, but sometimes to adapt aroung my disability. I intend to get better at opensourcing things - soz.

Also, the website seems pointless, so I might close that down soon.
